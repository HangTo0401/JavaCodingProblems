     * Working With Date And Time
     * 70. Finding the first/last day of the month
     *
     * The proper solution to this problem will rely on JDK 8's, Temporal and
     * TemporalAdjuster interfaces.
     * The Temporal interface sits behind representations of date-time. In other
     * words, classes that represent a date and/or a time implement this interface.
     *
     * For example, the following classes are just a few that implement this
     * interface:
     *      LocalDate (date without a time zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system)
     *      LocalTime (time without a time zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system)
     *      LocalDateTime (date-time without a time zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system)
     *      ZonedDateTime (date-time with a time zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system), and so on
     *      OffsetDateTime (date-time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system)
     *      HijrahDate (date in the Hijrah calendar system)
     *
     * The TemporalAdjuster class is a functional interface that defines strategies
     * that can be used to adjust a Temporal object.
     * Beside the possibility of defining custom strategies,
     * the TemporalAdjuster class provides several predefined
     * strategies, as follows (the documentation contains the entire list, which is
     * pretty impressive):
     *      firstDayOfMonth() (return the first day of the current month)
     *      lastDayOfMonth() (return the last day of the current month)
     *      firstDayOfNextMonth() (return the first day of the next month)
     *      firstDayOfNextYear() (return the first day of the next year)
     *
     * Notice that the first two adjusters in the preceding list are exactly the ones
     * needed by this problem.
     * Consider a fixâ€”LocalDate:
     * */
