     * copies (copy everything).
     *
     * SOLUTIONS: There are 6 solutions to clone object in Java

     * Using clone() method
     * Using Copy constructor
     * Using CLONING LIBRARY
     * Using Serialization
     * Using JSON

     * populate its fields with the fields of the current Point.
     *
     * The returned Point is a shallow copy
     * (since Point doesn't depend on other objects, a deep copy will

    /**
     * 2. The second solution use clone() method
     * The Object class contains a method named clone().
     * This method is useful for creating shallow copies
     * (it can be used for deep copies as well).
     *
     * In order to use it, a class should follow the given steps:
     * a. Implement the Cloneable interface (if this interface is not
     * implemented, then CloneNotSupportedException will be thrown).
     *
     * b. Override the clone() method (Object.clone() is protected).
     *
     * c. Call super.clone().
     *
     * Note that: The Cloneable interface doesn't contain any methods.
     * It is just a signal for JVM that this object can be cloned.
     * Once this interface is implemented,
     * the code needs to override the Object.clone() method.
     *
     * The reason why we have to override the Object.clone() method
     * because Object.clone() is protected, and in order to call it via super,
     * the code needs to override this method.
     * This can be a serious drawback
     * if clone() is added to a child class
     * since all superclasses should define a clone() method
     * in order to avoid the failure of the super.clone() chain invocation.
     *
     * This is shown in the following code:
     * @return CloningObjects
     * */

    /**
     * 4. The fourth solution to clone object via the Cloning library using Deep Copy
     * A deep copy is needed when an object depends on another object.
     * Performing a deep copy means copying the object, including its chain of
     * dependencies.
     * For example, let's assume that Point has a field of the Radius type:
     *
     * Performing a shallow copy of Point will create a copy of x and y,
     * but will not create a copy of the radius object.
     *
     * This means that modifications that affect the radius object
     * will be reflected in the clone as well.
     * It's time for a deep copy.
     *
     * A cumbersome solution will involve adapting the shallow copy techniques
     * previously presented to support a deep copy.
     *
     * Fortunately, there are a few solutions that can be applied out of the box,
     * and one of them is the Cloning library
