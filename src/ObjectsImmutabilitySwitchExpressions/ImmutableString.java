     * 1.48 Immutable String
     * Every programming language has a way of representing strings.
     *
     * As primitive types, strings are part of the predefined types,
     * and they are used in almost every type of Java application.
     *
     * In Java, strings are not represented by a primitive type
     * like int, long, and float.
     *
     * They are represented by a reference type named String.
     *
     * Almost any Java application uses strings,
     * for example, the main() method of a Java application
     * gets as an argument an array of the String type.
     *
     * The notoriety of String and its wide range of applications means we should
     * know it in detail.
     *
     * Besides, knowing how to declare and manipulate strings
     * (for example, reverse, and capitalize) developers should understand why this
     * class was designed in a special or different way.
     *
     * More precisely, why is String immutable?
     * Or maybe this question has a better resonance
     * formulated like thisâ€”what are the pros and cons of String being immutable?
     * */
