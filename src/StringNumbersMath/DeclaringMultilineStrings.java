     * String Manipulation
     * 1.19 Declaring Multiline Strings (text blocks)
     *
     * SOLUTIONS: There are 4 solutions to this problem
     *
     * Starting with JDK 13, the idea was reconsidered and, unlike the declined raw
     * string literals, text blocks are surrounded by three double quotes, """, as
     * follows:
     *
     * String text = """My high school""";
     *
     * Text blocks can be very useful for writing multiline SQL statements,
     * using polyglot languages, and so on.
     * More details can be found at https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355.
     *
     * Nevertheless, there are several surrogate solutions
     * that can be used before JDK 13
     * These solutions have a common pointâ€”the use of the line separator:
     * private static final String LS = System.lineSeparator();
     * */
