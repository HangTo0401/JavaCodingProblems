# Problems
This chapter includes 20 problems that involve date and time. These
problems are meant to cover a wide range of topics (converting, formatting,
adding, subtracting, defining periods/durations, computing, and so on) via
Date, Calendar, LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZoneDateTime,
OffsetDateTime, OffsetTime, Instant, and so on. By the end of this chapter,
you will have no problems in shaping date and time, while conforming to
your application's needs. The fundamental problems presented in this
chapter will be very helpful for obtaining the bigger picture regarding datetime APIs, 
and will act like the pieces of the puzzle that need to be pieced
together in order to resolve complex challenges involving date and time.

Problems
Use the following problems to test your date and time programming
prowess. I strongly encourage you to give each problem a try before you turn
to the solutions and download the example programs:
58. Converting a string to date and time: Write a program that
exemplifies conversions between a string and date/time.
59. Formatting date and time: Explain the format pattern for
date and time.
60. Getting the current date/time without time/date: Write a
program that extracts the current date without the time or date.
61. LocalDateTime from LocalDate and LocalTime: Write a program
that builds a LocalDateTime from LocalDate object and LocalTime.
It combines the date and time in a single LocalDateTime object.
62. Machine time via an Instant class: Explain and give an
example of the Instant API.
63. Defining a period of time using date-based values
(Period) and a duration of time using time-based values
(Duration): Explain and give an example of the usage of the
Period and Duration APIs.
64. Getting date and time units: Write a program that
extracts the date and time units (for example, extract from date
the year, month, minute, and so on) from an object representing a
date-time.
65. Adding and subtracting to/from a date-time: Write a
program that adds (and subtracts) an amount of time (for
example, years, days, or minutes) to a date-time object (for
example, add an hour to date, subtract 2 days from LocalDateTime,
and so on).
66. Getting all time zones with UTC and GMT: Write a program
that displays all the available time zones with UTC and GMT.
67. Getting the local date-time in all available time
zones: Write a program that displays the local time in all the
available time zones.
68. Displaying date-time information about a flight: Write a
program that displays information about a scheduled flight time
of 15 hours and 30 minutes. More precisely, a flight from
Perth, Australia to Bucharest, Europe.
69. Converting a Unix timestamp to date-time: Write a
program that converts a Unix timestamp to java.util.Date and
java.time.LocalDateTime.
70. Finding the first/last day of the month: Write a program
that finds the first/last day of the month via JDK 8,
TemporalAdjusters.
71. Defining/extracting zone offsets: Write a program that
reveals different techniques for defining and extracting zone
offsets.
72. Converting between Date and Temporal: Write a program that
converts between Date and Instant, LocalDate, LocalDateTime, and
so on.
73. Iterating a range of dates: Write a program that iterates a
range of given dates, day by day (with a step of a day).
74. Calculating age: Write a program that calculates the age of a
person.
75. Start and end of a day: Write a program that returns the start
and end time of a day.
76. Difference between two dates: Write a program that
calculates the amount of time, in days, between two dates.
77. Implementing a chess clock: Write a program that
implements a chess clock.

Solutions
The following sections describe solutions to the preceding problems.
Remember that there usually isn't a single correct way to solve a particular
problem. Also, remember that the explanations shown here include only the
most interesting and important details that are needed to solve the
problems. Download the example solutions to see additional details and to
